- [x] **Assembly**
An assembly language, often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions. Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture and operating system.

- [x] **Autoit**
AutoIt is a freeware automation language for Microsoft Windows. In its earliest release, the software was primarily intended to create automation scripts for Microsoft Windows programs but has since grown to include enhancements in both programming language design and overall functionality.
- [x] **BASIC**
BASIC is a family of general-purpose, high-level programming languages whose design philosophy emphasizes ease of use. In 1964, John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz designed the original BASIC language at Dartmouth College. They wanted to enable students in fields other than science and mathematics to use computers.

- [x] **Brainfuck**
Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban Müller, and notable for its extreme minimalism. The language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer. While it is fully Turing complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers.

- [x] **C**

C is a high-level and general-purpose programming language that is ideal for developing firmware or portable applications. Originally intended for writing system software, C was developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie for the Unix Operating System in the early 1970s.

HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

- [x] **INTERCAL**

INTERCAL was created in 1972 by two hackers from Princeton as a parody to satirizes various aspects of programming languages then.

Though the programmer might be driven into advanced stages of insanity from the attempt.

- [x] **Juliar**

- [x] **Kotlin**

Kotlin is a statically typed programming language that runs on the Java virtual machine and also can be compiled to JavaScript source code or use the LLVM compiler infrastructure.

- [x] **Lisp**
Lisp (historically, LISP derived from "LISt Processor") is a family of computer programming languages originally specified in 1958,  is the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today. Only Fortran is older, by one year. Lisp was originally created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs, influenced by the notation of Alonzo Church's lambda calculus. It quickly became the favored programming language for artificial intelligence (AI) research. Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science, including tree data structures, automatic storage management, dynamic typing, conditionals, higher-order functions, recursion, the self-hosting compiler, and the read–eval–print loop.
